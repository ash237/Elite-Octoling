Check the references folder for visual references of the instructions provided here!

Please make sure that when a song is loaded, all the spritesheets for that song are loaded too. I don't wanna risk desyncing anything from loading a sheet midway through.
The stage layout is mostly based on week 5, so you can use that as your reference


Song 1


It starts with a video curscene that I haven't finished yet.
Following the video cutscene is a doalogue cutscene. the source for it is in data, the portraits are all in one spritesheet. 
The background uses the sheets Upper_Bop_A and Lower_Bop_A
The opponent in this song uses all the sprites that start with p1 from the Ezili.png sheet
The idle animation should bop one every other beat.




Song 2 - Octo Amazone 


It starts with a dialogue cutscene, also found in data
The background uses the sheets Upper_Bop_B and Lower_Bop_B

For the first 43 seconds the opponent sprites are all the ones that starts with p2
The opponent idle animation now bops every beat
On the exact beat that ends the opponent section around 43 seconds, the gun_pullout animation of the Ezili_Gun sheet should be triggered



This will transition into a section with special mechanics:

In this special section, the camera zooms out a bit and has both characters on screen in a fixed position.
The opponent sprites during this section are an alternating loop between gun_loop_1 and gun_loop_2, each lasting 1 beat (like GF)
If during this section the player misses, the opponent displays the gun_shot animation, and the player the BF_splat animation. Also the splat_hit.oog sound effect will be heard.
This will do massive damage to the player. 90% of the total HP on hard mode, 50% on normal, and 30 % on easy
Make sure the gun loop animations are still synced up with the beat after the gun_shot animation

The camera position will trigger at 0:43, but the mechanics will trigger on the exact beat at 0:47 when the gun_pullout animation ends
This section will end when the player's turn ends at around 01:01

After this section, all of the opponent sprites are now the ones that start with p3, normal mechanics are restored



The special section starts again at 1:29
The only difference is that the opponent sings with the p3 sprites, when the opponent doesn't thing it's still the gun_loop_1 and gun_loop_2 sprites
the special section ends when the player turn ends at around 01:56
Exactly on this beat the Ezili_Dance animation should trigger. I haven't finished this one yet, but there is a placeholder that includes the first frame so you can place it.

From then everything proceeds as normal, opponent sprites are still the p3 ones

After the last note of the chart, the player sprite will play the BF_exit animation and the splat_exit.oog sound effect plays. Trigger them at the same time, they should sync up.
